# ESP8266-IoT
How to start with arduino IDE 

## Go to ```C:\Program Files\Arduino```
 - Into this you have to add the libraries you need to use. In my case I need the libraries contained into this repo.

## Start Arduino and open Preferences window.

- Enter ```https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json``` into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
- Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and find esp8266 platform.
- Select the version you need from a drop-down box.
- Click install button.
- Donâ€™t forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation.
